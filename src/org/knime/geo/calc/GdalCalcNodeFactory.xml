    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        This node takes multiple raster columns as input and perform a row-wise <a href="http://www.gdal.org/gdal_calc.html">raster calculation</a>
        with provided logical expression. You also need to provide output directory location. The output table contains the generated raster file locations after calculation.
        </intro>
        
        
        <option name="Locatin of calculated raster">Location of the output folder where your calculated raster files will be generated. 
        It will also generate a text file "commands.txt" in this location that contains all the commands use for generating raster.
        The commands in this file can be run separately as a batch file.</option>
        <option name="Logical expression">The logical expression for calculating raster in gdalnumeric syntax. 
        In the expression your can use the number of variables equal to the number of columns. The variable names should be 
        in capital alphabet in order (A,B,C,..) </option>
