    <shortDescription>
        This node burns vector geometries into a raster
    </shortDescription>
    
    <fullDescription>
        <intro>
        This node takes a list of raster file location in the input table, perform the raterize using <a href="http://www.gdal.org/gdal_rasterize.html">gdal_rasterize </a>
        command and generate a list of output rasters in the desired location. The output table contains the generated raster file locations.
        </intro>
        <option name="Output File Resolution (X and Y)">Set output file resolution (X and Y) (in target georeferenced units). Both must be positive values.</option>
        <option name="Attribute Name">Identifies an attribute field on the features to be used for a burn-in value. The value will be burned into all output bands.</option>
        <option name="No Data Value">Assign a specified nodata value to output bands.</option>
        <option name="Target Aligned Pixels">Target aligned pixels. Check this box if you want to align the coordinates of the extent of the output file to the values of the -output file resolution, such that the aligned extent includes the minimum extent.</option>
        <option name="Output Type">For the output bands to be of the indicated data type. Defaults to Float64</option>
        <option name="Output Format">Select the output format. The default is GeoTIFF (GTiff)</option>
        <option name="Output Folder Location">Location of the output folder where your new raster files will be generated. 
        It will also generate a text file "commands.txt" in this location that contains all the commands use for generating raster.
        The commands in this file can be run separately as a batch file.</option>
        <option name="Run commands">Check this option if you actually want to run the gdal commands. You have option
         to run it from the generated "commands.txt" file as a batch script if you decide not to run it. By default it is checked.</option>
